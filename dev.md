ComicPad Project: Complete Development Guide
üìã Project Overview
ComicPad is a Web3 platform that enables comic creators to mint NFTs and earn from their work. Based on the UI designs provided, the platform follows a 5-step process:
Choose your Comic Project - Create and manage comic projects
Create or Upload your Comic NFTs - Add episodes and metadata
Set Minting & Rewards Rules - Configure pricing and reward percentages
Go Live ‚Äì Let Fans Mint & Read - Publish episodes for public consumption
Track, Earn, & Build Community - Monitor earnings and engage with fans
üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The project uses an upgradeable proxy pattern to allow for future improvements while preserving state and user data. Here's the contract hierarchy:

ComicPadProxy (ERC1967 Proxy)
    ‚Üì delegates to
ComicPadV1 (Initial Implementation)
    ‚Üì upgrades to
ComicPadV2 (Enhanced Implementation)

Supporting Contracts:
- ComicNFT (ERC721 for comic episodes)
- ComicPadUpgrader (Manages upgrades)
- IComicPad (Interface definition)

üìù Step 1: Interface Design
IComicPad.sol
Interface Design Explanation:
Key Data Structures:
ComicProject: Represents a comic series with metadata, stats, and creator info
ComicEpisode: Individual episodes within a project with pricing and supply data
MintingRules: Configuration for how users can interact with episodes (read/mint)
Function Categories:
Creator Functions: Project/episode creation, rule setting, going live
User Functions: Minting NFTs, reading comics
Financial Functions: Earnings withdrawal
View Functions: Data retrieval
Admin Functions: Platform management

ComicPadV1 Architecture Breakdown:
1. Inheritance Pattern:
contract ComicPadV1 is 
    Initializable,           // OpenZeppelin's proxy initialization
    PausableUpgradeable,     // Emergency pause functionality
    OwnableUpgradeable,      // Access control
    UUPSUpgradeable,        // Upgrade mechanism
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, // Reentrancy protection
    IComicPad               // Interface compliance

2. State Variables Design:
Internal visibility: Allows inheritance by V2
Counter variables: Track next available IDs
Mappings: Efficient storage for projects, episodes, rules, and user interactions
Constants: Platform fee structure

3. Initialization Pattern:
contract ComicPadV1 is 
    Initializable,           // OpenZeppelin's proxy initialization
    PausableUpgradeable,     // Emergency pause functionality
    OwnableUpgradeable,      // Access control
    UUPSUpgradeable,        // Upgrade mechanism
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, // Reentrancy protection
    IComicPad               // Interface compliance

Let me show you the core business logic:
Step 1: Project Creation Logic
Validates input (title, genre limits)
Assigns incremental ID
Stores project with creator ownership
Initializes counters and flags
Step 2: Episode Addition Logic
Verifies creator permissions
Validates project state
Creates episode with metadata link
Updates project episode count
Let me show the minting rules and financial logic:
Step 3: Minting Rules Configuration
Flexible monetization: pay-per-read OR NFT minting OR both
Creator reward percentage (0-100%)
Supply limits for scarcity
Only editable before going live
Step 4: Publishing Logic
Simple state change to isLive
Only creator can publish
Irreversible action for episode activation
Now let's examine the core user interaction logic:
Step 5: User Interaction & Economics
NFT Minting Logic:
Validation: Episode is live, user hasn't minted, supply available
Payment Processing: Sufficient ETH sent
State Updates: Mark as minted, increment supply
Fee Distribution:
Creator gets configured percentage
Platform gets 2.5%
Remainder goes to platform owner
Token ID Assignment: Sequential token numbering
Reading Logic:
Similar fee structure for pay-per-read episodes
One-time payment per user per episode
Tracks reading history
